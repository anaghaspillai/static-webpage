<dt ><b>DevSkillsHub</b></dt>
<dd>Through this internship I was able to understand the various techniques of
data extraction and analysis and the use of NLP models <br>and SQL. I had the
privelege to work on a project related to handling data for 'Movie Theatre Selection
and Allocation' where I handled<br> data such as time and venue. I find it interesting
as such projects are based on real time applications & I was able to be a part of
it.</dd>
<dt ><b>SkillCraft Technology</b></dt>
<dd>Through this internship I was able to understand the various techniques of
Machine Learrning % related libraries such as sklearn, <br> kcluster for developing a
K-means cluster algorithm for customer classification, and the use of Support Vector
Machine and Convolutional <br>Neural Networks for hand gesture identification. I
was able to work with large datasets & fine tune models for better performance. </dd>
<dt><b>Intel Unnati Training Program 2024</b></dt>
<dd>This training program gave me an insight into data analysis and sentiment
analysis as I had to work on Sentiment Analysis from online <br>reviews on Intel
Products. I was able to provide models to perform a thorough eploratory data analysis, segmentation analysis, extraction of key <br>features and technical features, understanding of competition sentiments and user/ expert expectations. They were
done using various Machine <br>learning techniques using embedded libarires and
NLP models.</dd>
